***That's all We have got out Andoird Studio on Web which is cloud based.. ;)***

# Points to be noted before Creating a new Project in Android Studio & About Android Studio.

``` 
- Every time we restart old workspace Gitpod Creates new fresh environment which leads to reconfigure all the Android Studio from First.. :(
- All new Projects Should be Saved in the WorkSpace Folder -> AndroidStudioProjects.
```

## Why it is needed to Save Projects in that folder only?

> Because  Everytime we Created a new Workspace or restarted a workspace Gitpod creates a new environment rather than using old environment
>We Know that we need files to be stored some where to reuse the in gitpod.. So that we have to save the all changes to GitHub Which can 
hold upto 500 mb for a single repo..!
> This means we can save upto 10 Android Project in a single repo

## To Save Changes happened in Gitpod to reflect in Github..

Menu -> Terminal -> Run Task -> Save Changes.. [Choose Defaults what ever is next ]
